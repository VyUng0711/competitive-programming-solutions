SELECT later.Id
FROM
(SELECT Id as id, DATE_ADD(RecordDate , INTERVAL 1 day) as d, Temperature as t FROM Weather) previous
JOIN Weather later
ON previous.d = later.RecordDate
WHERE later.Temperature > previous.t


# A different solution:
SELECT Weather.Id FROM
Weather 
JOIN 
Weather w
ON DATEDIFF(Weather.RecordDate, w.RecordDate) = 1
WHERE Weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
