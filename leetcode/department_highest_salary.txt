SELECT d_name as "Department", Employee.Name as "Employee", new.max_salary as "Salary"

# A clearer approach:

SELECT Department.Name, Employee.Name, Salary
FROM Employee JOIN Department
ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE (DepartmentId, Salary)
IN
(SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentId)
